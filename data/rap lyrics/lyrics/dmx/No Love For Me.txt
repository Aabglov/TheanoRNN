Keep yo hands in the air, cause we gon take you there
And I know it aint fair, but we just dont care..
Uh-huh, uh, what
Chorus: dmx (repeat 2x)
Aint no other cats got love for me
Aint no cats gon bust slugs for me
Aint no cats gon shed blood for me
But my dogs, is gon be a thug for me
[dmx]
Uhh, uhh
If Im gonna rob, ima rob all night
If Im lookin for somethin its probably a fight
If Im goin fuck bitches then they better be tight
If thats dead, then the head better be right
If I gots to play ima play til I win
Since I gots to be here cant wait to begin
Wanna fuck shorty cant stand shorty friend
Cause honey friend fuck many many men
Stay wit the rats cause the rats is real
Wanna fuck, then we fuck, already know the deal
Shit, fuck what you look like, just show the real
And I keep spot that we can go to chill
I love my, get down for the hoes
Only reason I come around is for the hoes
Pipework - I lay it down for the hoes
Hit em off with that dark brown, you know?
Chorus
[drag-on]
Yknow fuckin wit me, aint keepin your health right
Cause me and my rolls, we keep it jail tight
The shit I pack is heavy, but the shell is light
When they drop the same time, you drop without a fight
Burnin anything that Im puttin my name on
You might take a drag, but you cant flame on
I know yall niggaz to homey, wit a chain on
When it come to the fire Im the kid they blame it on
When you see like eight cars then yall know who we are
Niggaz spittin mean bars off the green jar
Never drunk but you see me leaned at the bar
Spittin fire thatll melt the ice on your arm
You had that but for now dog give me that
Cause dog you dont wanna see how my semi act
Fake hustlin niggaz youll pump any pack
When it come to this shit, I done laid plenty flat (cmon!)
Chorus
[dmx]
Do you hear what I tell you? understand what you hear
Dont let nobody tell you, what to hope and to fear
Do you hear what I tell you? understand what you hear
Dont let nobody tell you, what to hope and to fear
Uhh, uhh
What you niggaz want? cause I got it right here
Yall niggaz front, then I hit you right there
Not really impressed by what niggaz wear
Faggots talk shit but I really dont care
Im the type of nigga thatll die for the cause
Fuck what you heard, I will die for my dogs
Aint scared of shit - will ride in the fog
Same thing but a bigger size than yours
I fuck with drag-on, cause he spits the flame
Drag-on motherfucker dont forget the name
And we all takin over aint shit the same
If you aint out that mob nigga quit the game
And aint no other cats got love for me
Aint no other cats gon bust slugs for me
Aint no other cats gon shed blood wit me
But my dogs, is gon be a thug wit me, cmon!
Chorus
[dmx]
Do you hear what I tell you? understand what you hear

Do you hear what I tell you? understand what you hear
Dont let nobody tell you, what to hope and to fear

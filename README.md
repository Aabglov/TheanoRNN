# TheanoSeq2Seq
A theano implementation of a character sequence-to-sequence RNN
All of these files are attempts to create a word-reverser.

The RMSProp and LBFGS versions are non-functional, but contain a lot of helpful structural code.
They're kept around for reference and as a way to see what I've already played around with.

If you've stumbled upon this I warn you none of these are complete.  Particularly theanoEmbed is still under active development.  Copy and paste at your own risk.

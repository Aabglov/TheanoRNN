[Verse 1: The D.O.C.]
big baller, of blind diggy
black foe dipply
quickly, run into your city like Jeepsy
I kept a half of ounce
and I'm rude to get the cash and bounce
51 mansion, I ain't stopped, see what doin' the asking
all these player haters doin' this blasting
so while these fools words be heated like fashion
I'm gon' cash-in, what, I'm workin' with a full grip
ain't no featurin' that bullshit, so I'll pull shit
out like a presidential
sleek and stay illegal like the governmental
fake is backache, all the time
got my shit lookin' bright like a shoes shine
rub you off like massage when I'm on the grind
cause in my mind
you better get yours, cause I'ma get mine, fool.....
[Chorus: Dr. Dre]
stackin' them bricks got you trippin'
them bricks and them cakes got you slippin'
a flock of birds got you on the yard sippin'
or gettin' cheese in pay, all day, Gorilla Pympin'
stackin' them bricks got you trippin'
them bricks and them cakes got you slippin'
a flock of birds got you on the yard sippin'
or maybe gettin' paid, all day, Gorilla Pympin'
[Verse 2: The D.O.C.]
now I'ma drop into it right quick, G shit
you finna get the convict, subliminal bomb shit
criminal, monoply, philosophy
mean dollar properties, cheese overseas, status
peep my macks are my apparatus
known for my gift the Grammer
from Atlanta to Atlantis, I handle this, pound for pound
brought you the scandalous, break it down
I'm gonna give you what you need
full balls, big dick and straight weed
or get wet up fool you better get up
and get yours from the D.O.P, fuckin' with me
smooth Jackson, Bro Bax and Kool Max
on criminal contacts be lovin' my platinum plaques
but that ain't who I'ma goes at
on the real, dollar bills mothafucker, can you afford that.....
[Chorus: Dr. Dre]
stackin' them bricks got you trippin'
them bricks and them cakes got you slippin'
a flock of birds got you on the yard sippin'
or gettin' cheese in pay, all day, Gorilla Pympin'
stackin' them bricks got you trippin'
them bricks and them cakes got you slippin'
a flock of birds got you on the yard sippin'
or maybe gettin' paid, all day, Gorilla Pympin'

[Verse 3: Six Two]
Knick Knack Patty Wack, give the dog a bone
now give him a chicken till my nigga is on

and you can send them viberatin' when you dropped
hot jam, better then the rest of them

I pack a flour when I'm on my tour
if we can make it though, niggaz actin' hardcore
it ain't the coast though, nigga it's the cash flow
order ass-holes, for sheezy best believe me

uh the grand finale, on my way back from Cali'
fuckin twin bitches, and they grins for they ends
and it's on nigga, rocks slangin' to you like the dirty cop
clock till the world stopped, make them all dropped
my nigga Doc' empty out the whole box
I set it off, come on, come out get yours
talkin' about your old black clothes
Caddillac doors, money from bad hoes
you know that's how Gorilla Pympin' goes
realize that you gotta get yours
all dimes, all the time
you better get yours, cause I'ma get mine, fool.....
[Chorus: Dr. Dre]
stackin' them bricks got you trippin'
them bricks and them cakes got you slippin'
a flock of birds got you on the yard sippin'
or gettin' cheese in hate, all day, Gorilla Pympin'
stackin' them bricks got you trippin'
them bricks and them cakes got you slippin'
a flock of birds got you on the yard sippin'
or maybe gettin' paid, all day, Gorilla Pympin'

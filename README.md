# TheanoSeq2Seq
A theano implementation of a character sequence-to-sequence RNN

The RMSProp and LBFGS versions are non-functional, but contain a lot of helpful structural code.
They're kept around for reference and as a way to see what I've already played around with.

The meat of this repo is theanoEmbed.py.  It needs a little cleaning, but the working structure is there.  I'm currently playing around with a toy problem of trying to get it to memorize a sentence.

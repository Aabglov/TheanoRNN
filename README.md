# Theano RNN
A multi-purpose Recurrent Neural Network framework built in Theano.

This started out as a simple framework for neural networks, but blossomed into a full exploration of RNNs.  It was a satisfying exercise that helped me understand both the fundamentals and intricacies of Recurrent nets.  

While I'm happy with the final version of these demos they're limited by the somewhat clunky way Theano handles loops (see all my ramblings about the Theano.scan() method for more details).  This module is great for opening up the body of a RNN and seeing what it does, but not recommended for production environments.

Use at your own risk :)

(He's) Mentally ill from Amityville (He'll)
Accidentally kill your family still
Thinkin' he won't, God damnit, he will (He's)
Mentally ill from Amityville

I get lifted and spin 'til I'm half-twisted
Feet planted and stand with a grin full of chapped
Lipstick
Pen full of ink, think sinful and raps sick shit
Shrink, pencil me in for my last visit
Drink Gin 'til my chin's full of splashed whiskers
Hash Whiskey and ash 'til I slap bitches
Ask Bizzy, he's been here the past 6 years
Mash with me again and imagine this
(He's) Mentally ill from Amityville (He'll)
Accidentally kill your family still
Thinkin' he won't, God damnit, he will (He's)
Mentally ill from Amityville

Fuck my cousin in his asshole, slit my mother's throat
Hehe, guess who Slim Shady just signed to Interscope
My little sisters birthday, she'll remember me
For a gift I had ten of my
Boy's take her virginity
And bitches know me as a horny-ass freak
Her mother wasn't raped; I ate her pussy while she was
Asleep
Pissy drunk throwing up in a urinal (YOU FUCKING
HOMO!)
That's what I said up at my dad's funeral
(He's) Mentally ill from Amityville (He'll)
Accidentally kill your family still

That's why the city is filled with a bunch of fuckin'
Idiots still
That's why the first motherfucker poppin' some shit
He gets killed
That's why we don't call it "Detroit", we call it
"Amityville"
You can get capped after just having a cavity filled
That's why they're crowned the murder capital still
This ain't Detroit, this is motherfuckin' Hamburger
Hill
We don't do drive-bys; we park in front of houses and
Shoot
And when the police come, we fuckin' shoot it out with
Them too
That's the mentality here, that's the reality here
Did I just hear somebody say they wanna challenge me
Here?
While I'm holdin' a pistol with this many calibers
Here?
Try some registration, it just made the shit valid
This year?
'Cause once I snap, I can't be held accountable for my
Actions
That's when accidents happen, when a thousand bullets
Come at your house
And collapse the foundation around you when they found
You and your family in it
God damnit, admit it when he told you
(He's) Mentally ill from Amityville (He'll)
Accidentally kill your family still
Thinkin' he won't, God damnit, he will (He's)

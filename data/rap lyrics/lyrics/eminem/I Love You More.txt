eminem: you still love me?
[kim]: (sniffles)
eminem: take this(click, click)...ready? [her sniffle again] 1, 2, 3 (bang bang)
the more you, put me through
the more it makes me wanna come back to you
you say you hate me, i just love you more
you dont want me, i just want you more
i buy you flowers
you throw them at me
i know its sad but its making me happy
the more that you slap me,
the more that it turns me on
cuz you love me
and i love you more
its sick but who could ever predict
we'd be doin the same shit
we say we do it for our baby, but we dont
we do it for us, its lust
cuz neither one of us trusts each other
so we fuck till we bust
and then we cuss each other, out,
we know what its about
and shout till i throw you out the house,
you throw me out the house,
i throw you on the couch,
punch you in the mouth
fist fight till we turn this mother out
and apologize after, laughter, pain
its insane, were back in the same chapter again,
and its sad but its true, when im layin here wit'chu
there aint nothin anyone could ever say or ever do cuz
the more you put me through
the more it makes me wanna come back to you
you say you hate me, i just love you more
you dont want me, i just want you more
i buy you flowers
you throw them at me
i know its sad but its making me happy
the more that you slap me,
the more that it turns me on
cuz you love me
and i love you more
cuz i hate you, do you hate me?
good cuz you're so fuckin beautiful when you're angry
it makes me, wanna just take you
and just throw you on the bed
and fuck you like i dont even know you
you fuck other people and i fuck other people
you're a slut but im equal, ima mut
we're both evil in our ways
but neither one of us would ever admit it
cuz one of us would have one up on the other, so forget it
people make, accusations, people spread rumors,
but they aint got proof
till they do, its just the two of us, its you and me
cuz any chick can say that shes screwin me
but you gotta believe me to a degree cuz you're in deep
if you didnt i wouldn't be hitting
yeah i would cuz the sex is just too damn good
if i ran, who would i run to?
who would be this soft and warm
so its off and on, usually more off than on
but at least we know,
that we share this common bond
you're the only one i could fuck without a condom on
i hope, the only reason that i cope
is cuz of that fact and plus i can bust in that
and thats why
the more you put me through
the more it makes me wanna come back to you
you say you hate me, i just love you more
you dont want me, i just want you more
i buy you flowers
you throw them at me
i know its sad but its making me happy
the more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on
cuz you love me
and i love you more
i can never understand it,
thats why i dont try
from junior high, until we both die
its silly oh why, must we try?
is it really so rough?
did we must and always call
each others billy-goat's gruff?
try to pull each others legs, until the other begs,
were lying to ourselves
thats the beauty of it, yeah
cuz we truely love each other
thats why we always fight,
and all we do is shove each other
every other fuckin night
and its clear, it aint gonna change
this pin up rage, we both have,
and we both feel like we've been upstaged
by someone else, we've both been someone else
with someone else
the problem is, neither one wont tell
its an addiction, and it cant be fixed
our familys mixed up
theres baby sister in the mix
and it hurts, cuz the pieces to the puzzle dont fit
and anybody who thinks he knows us doesn't know shit
and they're probably just tired of hearing it all the time,
on every song, every lyric and every rhyme,
all the hoop-lah, all of the whoopty woo,
what you put me through, fuckin whoopty-doo
but i wont be made a fool of,
if this is true love, you wouldnt do what you did last time,
you wouldnt screw up this time,
cuz this time, girl im telling you what,
you do it again im fucking you up,
no matter what
what you say, what you do,
ima hunt you down till i find you
no matter where you run
ill be right there, right behind you
and in your nightmares i surround you.
i buy you flowers, and candy
all the times that you threw them back at me
told me you hate me
you gonna hate me more
when you find out,
you cant escape me whorrrre
the more you, put me through
the more it makes me wanna come back to you
you say you hate me, i just love you more.
you dont want me, i just want you more.
i buy you flowers
you throw them at me
i know its sad but its making me happy.
the more that you slap me,
the more that it turns me on,
cuz you love me
and i love you more.

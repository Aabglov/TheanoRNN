I have known Mr. Smith for more than five years, as I was his Course Director and Professor of Macroeconomics at National Goodwell University.\u000aMr. Smith is quite simply an outstanding student. He welcomed the complex challenges presented in my Macroeconomics course, and he took the initiative to engage in further discussion after class. He is extremely hard-working and truly insightful; these two traits combine to produce an especially unique and outstanding student.\u000aMr. Smith's academic ability is first-rate. He displays impressive logical thinking abilities and an intellectual curiosity beyond that of his peers. He was always an active participant in classes who listened eagerly and never hesitated to raise questions. Specifically, as regards his application for the MSc in Financial Economics, Mr. Smith has a strong academic background in relevant academic areas, and his academic performance ranked him firmly in the top of his class. Because of his drive and ambition, I am confident that Mr. Smith will remain in the top of his class and continue to display excellent academic performance.\u000aI expect Mr. Smith to respond to the challenges of the master\u2019s program with a rigorous devotion to excellence, and I am certain that his intellect is capable of handling even the most demanding courses available. Mr. Smith refuses to be daunted by challenging coursework; rather, when confronted with complex issues, he simply devotes himself and seeks further clarification until he has a firm understanding.\u000aAside from his outstanding academic qualities, Mr. Smith has a wealth of practical experience.

After witnessing Ms. Smith\u2019s performance in my class, I can state with confidence that she will be a positive addition to your institution.\u000aI instructed Ms. Smith in the courses Introduction to Management 1 and 2, which she took over the course of one year. Ms. Smith quickly showed herself to be a conscientious student, and she did not hesitate to participate in discussions and raise various concerns and questions of her own. It was evident from the beginning of the class that she has a strong interest in the subject matter, and this was reflected in her grades as well. I am pleased to learn that Ms. Smith now hopes to pursue further studies in business and management, and based on her performance in this class, I feel strongly that she is well-suited for such a course of study.\u000aStudying in your graduate school will inevitably bring many challenges and demands. I believe that Ms. Smith is uniquely suited to face these demands. When she took my course Introduction to Management, she, unlike her classmates, was not a business student, but rather was taking the class in order to pursue her interest in the subject matter. In this way, she was at a disadvantage, as many of her classmates had already received varying levels of instruction and training in business. Ms. Smith proved undeterred, however. She is a quick learner and she is confident in her abilities. When faced with challenges, she confronts them head on and seems to enjoy the process of learning and overcoming difficulties.\u000aI was quite impressed by Ms. Smith\u2019s performance and attitude in my course, and it is for these reasons that I wholeheartedly recommend her to your program. I believe that she possesses the determination and intellect to complete the course of study and progress to a successful career.

I have known her for twenty years.\u000aAnnik has always displayed a high degree of integrity, responsibility, and ambition. She is definitely a leader rather than a follower.

He had moved in with his father in the same building in which I lived. Not long after he arrived, he noticed me in the elevator with my squash gear and asked me in his rudimentary English if I would play squash with him, to which I agreed. \u000aWhen he first arrived in this country, Michael registered in the final year of high school to improve his English. In fact, during that first year I often tutored him in English and History in the evenings which allowed me to get to know him quite well. I quickly realized that not only was Michael very bright, he was an incredibly hard working individual who was determined to overcome all challenges he faced. Accordingly, within one year he was quite fluent in English, with very little accent, and he had finished at the top of his class in high school. In addition to that, in parallel with his studies he managed to hold down two part-time jobs.\u000aAfter that, Michael was accepted into university on a partial scholarship in another city. Although we didn't see each other for about three years we kept in touch by e-mail and I could see that he was continuing to excel in his studies. After three years he graduated with an Honors degree in Biochemistry.\u000aAfter a short stint doing research with a pharmaceutical company in Toronto, Michael moved to Montreal six years ago to pursue his dream of becoming a medical doctor. While he was studying medicine at McGill University in Montreal I saw quite a bit of him and was well aware of his progress as he moved through medical school. Last year Michael realized his dream and graduated near the top of his class as an M.D. He is currently a plastics and reconstructive surgery resident at a major Montreal hospital. \u000aClearly, Michael's deeds speak for themselves. He is a highly intelligent hard worker who never loses sight of his goals. He is also a fine person with a great deal of integrity who I am proud to call a friend. I therefore have no hesitation whatsoever in unreservedly recommending Michael Meloche as a trustworthy person who can always be counted on, regardless of the enterprise.\u000a\u000aIf you have questions or need additional information about my knowledge of Michael please free to call me in Montreal at (514) 978-1789.\u000a\u000aSincerely,\u000a\u000aSamuel Francis, M.B.A.\u000a[Senders Name]\u2028[Address line 1]\u2028[Address line 2]\u2028[State, ZIP Code]\u000a\u2028\u2028\u000a\u2028\u2028Writing a personal reference letter for a friend.\u000a\u000a[Letter Date]\u000a\u2028\u000a[Recipients Name]\u2028[Address line 1]\u2028[Address line 2]\u2028[State, ZIP Code]\u2028\u2028[Subject: Normally bold, summarizes the intention of the letter] -Optional-\u2028\u2028\u2028Dear [Recipients Name],\u000aI hope this letter finds you well.

I have known her for more than 3 years in my capacity as a senior lecturer of the Department of Economics. During her 3rd year I was her Professor for Advanced Economic Theory and Growth Development and Planning.\u000a \u000aHer Project Titled Yokogawa Blue Star Private Limited was among the few best projects carried out in the Department.\u000a \u000aShe has shown the motivation, intelligence, preserving nature and analytical aptitude for graduate study. Her attendance and her presence of mind has been a key part of her study program that has helped her to contribute positively while working as a part of the team.\u000a \u000aIn my view, Ms Anitha Ramaswamy compares favorably with the best among my student. I am sure, she will make an outstanding performance at her PG studies. I recommend her in the strongest term for admission to PG program at your university.\u000a                                                                    		                 Yours Sincerely,\u000a                                                                                                                                [Name]\u000a                    \u000a\u000aTo Whom It May Concern,\u000aI felt quite honored when my sister Barbara Jacobs asked me to write a reference letter for her.\u000aIn addition to raising a family and being a good wife, daughter and sister, Barbara has always found time to get involved in life around her. Unlike many people these days, whenever she adopts a cause or pursues a new interest she is guaranteed to be highly committed.\u000aBarbara is only six years older than I, but in terms of the influence she\u2019s had on my life she might as well have been my mother. She was an honors student in high school and studied Spanish for five years. As a thirteen year old, I often went with her to a special program run by our church that helped Hispanic immigrants learn to speak English. I watched Barbara take a deep interest in the lives of many of the people there. Sometimes she would bring me home, only to go back and spend additional hours helping old and young alike with their personal problems. By example, Barbara taught me not only the value of helping others, but the importance of loyalty and commitment.\u000aBarbara is also a problem solver. Much thought goes into the things Barbara does, and she has an unusual ability to notice what others overlook.\u000aI remember one Christmas her women\u2019s club took gifts of food to families in need. Noticing that a number of the families had been referred by the free clinic, she checked for cases of diabetes. She found that several families had diabetics in them. So she carefully replaced all high sugar foods with fresh fruits and vegetables- items she purchased herself.\u000aI could continue with descriptions of Barbara\u2019s many other good qualities- her work ethic, her energy, and her creativeness to name three. Instead I would simply like to say how much I think of Barbara and how strongly I recommend her for any task that requires problem solving and a high level of commitment.\u000aSincerely,\u000aDoris Martin\u000a\u000aLetter of Reference\u000aTo Whom It May Concern,\u000aOur babysitter, Sarah Anderson, is a delightful young woman who has cared for our two children over the last several years.\u000aSarah is not your usual sitter. Our children do not endlessly sit for hours in front of the television while in her care. She goes to extra effort to bring books from the public library that both of our children would enjoy. Sometimes instead of reading to them herself, she will help our son Tom read a story to his young sister.  Other times she will bring board or card games to play with our son after his sister goes to bed.\u000aSarah has even managed to convince Tom that carrot and celery sticks along with an assortment of fresh fruits are really \u201cfun foods\u201d.\u000aIn addition, Miss Anderson shares her love of music with our children. Her musical interests run from classical to contemporary. Sometimes they all sit quietly and listen to music. On other occasions you can find them dancing or exercising to their favorite songs. Even though Tom is only six years old he enjoys singing. As a result of this, Sarah teaches him little tunes that he proudly performs for us.\u000aOften my husband and I return to find drawings, paintings or small craft projects that the kids have made with Sarah\u2019s patient assistance.\u000aWe have found her unselfish and diligent care of our children a true blessing and confidently recommend her to you as a sitter.\u000aSincerely,\u000aGary and Darla Benson\u000a\u000aCHARACTER REFERENCE LETTER\u000a\u000aTo Whom It May Concern\u000aI have been working with Mr/Mrs [name] in a variety of capacities for the last twelve years.

Ms. Jones has taken three different courses with me over the span of her four-year college stay, and every minute with her has been a joy. I have also acted as an academic advisor for Ms. Jones and have visited with her one-on-one many times, so I can safely say that I have a very firm grasp on Amanda\u2019s personality, ethics, and work habits. I hope that this reference expresses the trust I have in the abilities of Ms. Jones to fulfill the duties of employment within your company. \u000a\u000aAmanda has shown herself to be an honest, hard-working, and personable individual. I am confident that she would be a valuable asset to any organization, because she was such an asset in my classrooms. Amanda was an active participant in all classroom discussions and activities, encouraging an environment of inclusion for all other students as well. She was adept at fostering healthy discourse in small groups of peers as well as effortlessly capturing the attention of larger groups. \u000a\u000aIn addition to her school work, Amanda worked with volunteer organizations outside of the school setting. She has proven herself to be a gentle and selfless individual when it comes to matters of social justice and is an expert at efficiently managing her time so she can be a part of all of these various communities.\u000a\u000aIn conclusion, I believe that Ms. Jones is an exemplary human being with the brain power, personality, and heart necessary to succeed in any setting.

Sam has been a friend of mine for seven years, and an employee for three. \u000a\u000aWe first met at a bike race in 2006. The enthusiasm and positive attitude that he showed throughout the race were infectious, and he made everyone racing around him better. I finished just behind Sam that day, and we have been close ever since. He is my motivation on a daily basis, he keeps me on track with health and fitness, and he is always willing to push me just a little further for my own good. He has not only been there for me as a fitness guru, but also as a great friend. In 2008 he was the best man at my wedding, and in 2010 he was one of the first people at the hospital for the birth of my daughter. \u000a\u000aWhen I opened the doors of my shop, BikeWorks, Sam offered to help out as a part-time bike mechanic. I hired him on without hesitation, and I can honestly say that the shop wouldn\u2019t be the same without him. In the years that I have been acquainted with him, Sam has shown himself to be a good-natured person as well as a talented bike mechanic. The opportunity to learn and grow in an environment on a larger scale than BikeWorks would benefit Sam greatly, and I am certain that his presence as an intern would benefit any company. \u000a\u000aSam is an incredibly loyal friend, just as he is an incredibly loyal employee. I can always find him in the shop, covered in grease, grinning from ear to ear. My other employees would all agree that he is a fantastic coworker. \u000a\u000aI am confident that an internship with your company would help Sam meet his full potential, and I am also positive that he would be a helpful and pleasant addition to your team. I appreciate your request and your time.\u000a\u000aSincerely, \u000a\u000aMike Powell\u000aProprietor of BikeWorks, Ltd.\u000aDanville, WA\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aOctober 26, 20xx\u000a\u000aTo Whom It May Concern:\u000aRe: Character Reference - Jeremy Swanson\u000a\u000aThe purpose of this is to provide a character reference for Mr. Jeremy Swanson whom I have known as a classmate, roommate, and friend for a period of five years.\u000aI first met Jeremy in our freshman year at Adirondack College. We were both studying a general arts program there and became acquainted through a number of common classes that we shared. By second year, we had become friends and decided to take an off-campus apartment together. We shared that living arrangement until we both graduated last year.\u000aAccordingly, having gotten to know Jeremy so well over the past few years, I believe puts me in a position to provide you with a pretty accurate assessment of his character.\u000aAs a student, Jeremy was a hard-working and highly committed to his education. I believe that his excellent transcripts will attest to that fact. In addition, he was quite involved in a number of extra-curricular activities including the track and field team and the school newspaper. In fact, in his last two years he was Assistant Editor of the "Campus Inquirer." Outgoing, and always willing to help someone out, Jeremy was very popular with his fellow students.\u000aAs a roommate, Jeremy was a great choice. He was very neat and tidy at all times and he liked things in the apartment to be kept orderly. He made a point of cleaning his own room and the common living areas on a regular basis. He socialized occasionally at home but was always respectful of my needs, and he and his guests kept the noise down and ended their activities at a reasonable hour.\u000aAs a friend, Jeremy Swanson is a standout. He is a loyal, honest, considerate, and supportive individual who has the ability to see and understand things from another person's perspective. He is a great direct communicator and knows how to raise and discuss common living issues and problems in a non-threatening manner. He is hyper-sensitive and is always tuned into how another person might "feel" in a given situation. He likes to have fun too. During our years at school we maintained an ongoing friendly rivalry on the squash courts.\u000aTo tell the truth, I really can't think of anything of consequence on the negative side of the personality ledger when it comes to Jeremy. All in all, I would have to say that Jeremy Swanson is a fine, well-balanced person with an abundance of positive qualities. \u000a\u000aSincerely,\u000aCharles Farmington\u000aMr. Jack Smith\u2028255 West 24th Street,\u2028Queens,\u2028NY - 10025\u2028Email: jsmith@email.org\u2028\u2028March 17, 2013\u2028\u2028To Whom It May Concern:\u2028\u2028I have had the privilege of knowing Adam since college and we have been the best of friends for over five years.\u2028\u2028I met Adam in our freshman year at the XYZ College. Since, we both had opted for the undergraduate degree in Fine Arts, we came to be in the same class.\u2028\u2028The first time I actually had a proper conversation with Adam, was during a class when we were being taught about visual arts and its evolution. He had something to contribute during the class, and I was impressed by his knowledge about the subject. Soon, we were the only two students who were exchanging our ideas with the professor.\u2028\u2028Even though we started out as cordial acquaintances, we were drawn to similar ideologies pertaining to art. We exchanged notes and worked on projects together. We enjoyed our brainstorming sessions so much that, we decided to become roommates during our second year.\u2028\u2028As I got to know Adam better, I realized how hardworking he actually is. I have seen him studying and making notes from books which were beyond our curriculum and adapting those concepts into his own work. I must add that, had it not been for him I wouldn't have fared half as well as I actually did. Adam's diligence and out-of-the-box thinking, inspired me to do the same and come up with my own ideas. Since fine arts is such a competitive domain, it was not an easy task to create a piece of art that could be deemed as your own. However, with Adam's help and guidance we excelled as a team.\u2028\u2028Adam also persuaded me into getting a part-time job, even though I wasn't in need of one. We constantly competed with one another in order to avoid becoming lethargic and stagnant. We used to start our day by playing basketball and whenever we go the time, we would play chess.\u2028\u2028He is also the most unselfish person I have ever had the fortune to meet. There have been innumerable instances, when he has canceled his prior plans, in order to look after me when I was unwell or down with a fever. I have also witnessed him buying food for the homeless on number of occasions, even when he himself was low on cash.\u2028\u2028All in all, Adam is one of the most honest and down-to-earth person I have ever befriended. He is a dynamic student, who is bound to bring innovative ideas onto the table.\u2028\u2028I also remember, how Adam always made sure that his grades stayed up, so that he could complete his master's degree from the prestigious ABC institute. Based on his academic performance as well as the wonderful person he is, I genuinely believe that Adam Slate is a suitable candidate for the ABC scholarship program.\u2028\u2028Sincerely,\u2028Signature\u2028Mark Brown\u2028\u2028\u000aTo,\u2028(Address)\u2028Contact number (optional)\u2028Email address\u2028\u2028Date:\u2028\u2028To Whom It May Concern:\u2028\u2028It has been (time period) years since I have known (friend's name), as both, a close friend and colleague.

I must appeal that Mr. Watson worked in my company, as junior financial analyst for 2 years. During his stay, he was found exceptionally good at analyzing the financial markets accurately.

Dave and me met at our first year in Wisconsin University, and later we also worked together for five years at Gracia Enterprises.\u2028\u2028Dave is a true optimist, and it is his positive attitude that helps him accomplish whatever task he has been assigned. Dave is a complete go-getter, who will go that extra mile to give his best to any project undertaken. Moreover, he is an excellent team leader, as he not only makes sure that the projects are completed on time, but also encourages his team members to put in their very best efforts.\u2028\u2028Above all his professional qualities and achievements, the thing that I admire the most in Dave is that he is a good human being.

He is an avid gardener who took care of my neighbor\u2019s yard. I asked for help and he made suggestions that helped me beautify my lot.\u000aJohn is organized and extremely competent. His knowledge of horticulture is astounding. He can name every plant or tree, blade of grass, and weed you point to. He also knows how to care for each or how to safely remove them without polluting. He\u2019s very friendly to everyone and extremely detail oriented and caring about plants.\u000aI would highly recommend John for any position he chooses to pursue in his career field. His knowledge would be a valuable asset.\u000aIf you have further questions, please contact me anytime.\u2028\u2028Sincerely,\u2028\u2028\u2028Your Name\u000a\u000aTo Whom it May Concern,\u2028\u2028One would always assume that it is the older sister who is responsible for her younger sister. But in Joanne's case, it was always she who took care of me. I am always puzzled by how she developed these motherly qualities, considering the fact that we lost our parents when we were very young. \u2028\u2028I think this nurturing quality comes naturally to Joanne. She cares, and that reflects in every aspect of her life, even in the plants she takes care of. Her husband Arnold, on the other hand, balances her highly caring nature with the strictness that it takes to be a parent, by ensuring that things are done in moderation. \u2028\u2028The only way I can assure you of the ability of Joanne and Arnold to parent a child is their relationship with my 7-year old daughter, Myra. The three of them share a bond that is as good as that of any parent with a child. They draw out her best, and it shows in the way she is evolving as a human being. \u2028\u2028To conclude, all I can say is both of them are dependable human beings who know the importance of raising a good human being who can add value to society. Should you have any further queries regarding the two, you may contact me on 9876-5432 or mary.jones@mjax.net.\u2028\u2028Sincerely,\u2028Mary Jones\u2028\u2028\u000aDear Ma'am/Sir (Name of Counselor/Admissions Officer),\u2028\u2028I could tell you that Mia Stevens is an excellent student, that her grades are far above average, and that her extracurricular achievements are beyond comparison. However, you already have the necessary documentation to tell you that. I'd rather talk about the qualities that make her an extraordinary person.\u2028\u2028Mia is someone who likes to be happy, and she leaves no stone unturned in spreading this happiness. She is a firm believer of the fact that the lesser you focus on the bad, the lesser it affects you. As a shining example of this fact, she is able to give her best to everything she does. A naturally talented girl, Mia has exceptional leadership qualities. She heads the book club at school, encourages reading as a hobby, and has the knack of discovering lesser-known but brilliant pieces of writing. She also organized the Woods High School Literary Fest with her team in 2012, an event that was a roaring success and even found a commendable mention in a leading daily.\u2028\u2028When she told me that she has applied for the Creative Writing program at your esteemed university, I was thrilled. The world needs such enthusiastic writers who have the sensibility to spread their knowledge to a larger number of people. It is highly unlikely that you will regret granting Mia the scholarship that she deserves. If anyone is worth every penny that your scholarship offers, it is Mia, and I can back this claim wholeheartedly.\u2028\u2028Sincerely,\u2028\u2028Mary Jones\u2028Principal\u2028Woods High School\u2028\u000aDay/Date\u2028\u2028To Whom it May Concern,\u2028\u2028It gives me great satisfaction to recommend Peter T. D'Costa for the 'Journalism for Courage' fellowship program as a part of specialized journalism course. I've known Peter for about 4 years as an undergraduate student in communication course of my university. I've worked with him closely on projects related to improvement of video and audio editing of news in college years. Even after leaving college, like most students, Peter had been in touch with me through mails, letters and calls. He personally visited me after he got an appreciation award for the documentary his team created on wildlife conservation programs in the US.\u2028\u2028Peter has brilliant charisma and an imposing personality. Full of enthusiasm, he has always been ready to cover news even during life-threatening situations. As a professor, I've known him for his excellent communication skills especially his writing skills. Besides being an academically oriented student, Peter loved performing for theaters and documentaries.\u2028\u2028Once Peter organized a campaign for spreading awareness about the increasing threat of AIDS. Initially, he wasn't supported by many, however as he moved ahead, the whole college was with him. I have an appreciation for his matured journalistic outlook on various matters. His character traits like integrity and honesty are what I cherish the most about him as a journalist. I'm confident that after attending your fellowship program, he will turn out be one of your best candidates.

We share a close relationship and he has been with me in all the ups and downs of life.\u2028\u2028During all my acquaintance with Peter, I've found him to be a trustworthy and honest person. Peter had an unstable childhood as his parents had issues with each other. Due to alcohol addiction, Peter's father died when he was 8 years old.\u2028\u2028Peter's mother raised him facing all the hardships of life. In an unfortunate accident, Peter lost his mother when he was 16 years old. Still, Peter has been with his relatives and has grown up to be a responsible citizen and a good father and a husband.\u2028\u2028As per the court's information and as told by Peter, I've come to know that Peter has been charged of damaging public property after over consumption of alcohol. Your Honor, Peter has told me that he was under the influence of alcohol and so that incident occurred. He is embarrassed about his behavior and is ready to pay the monetary penalty of the window and door that he broke. I know Peter since a long time and I'm aware that he is not an alcohol addict. So, I request you to please give him a chance to rectify his mistakes.\u2028\u2028Yours sincerely,\u2028(Signature)\u2028Neil' O Douglas\u2028\u2028\u000aReferrer's Name\u2028Referrer's Designation in his organization\u2028Referrer's Organization's Address\u2028Referrer's Official Phone Number\u2028Referrer's Official Email Address\u2028\u2028Date\u2028\u2028To Whomsoever it May Concern\u2028\u2028It gives me great pleasure to recommend [Employee's Name] for the job posting in your company.

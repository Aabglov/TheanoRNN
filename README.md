# VUDU
Vertically Unified Deep-learning Utility

This is a module designed to be my personal toolbox when tackling machine learning problems.  I've been unsatisfied with other python modules that focused on deep-learning because they either offer little functionality and lots of control or little control and lots of functionality.  I've also been frustrated with the lack of focus around core concepts behind the scenes and obfuscation of necessarcy components of computation.  So I made my own.  

This module helps me read the bones.
